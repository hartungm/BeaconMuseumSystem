Download the correct SDK for your system 
   (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads)

The scripts for running the development server as well as 
   deploying the application are contained within the SDK.
These scripts need not be in the same directory as the 
   app source folder (the one in here)

Python 2.7 must be used to run these scripts; if you are 
   running a Python 3.x version you must either downgrade 
   to 2.7 or make a different install of Python 2.7, 
   using that program to run the scripts.

At this point it is possible that deployment to this 
   particular app is only tied to my (Matt's) google 
   developer account.  This is fine; contact Matt if 
   you need a deploy to production.  All development 
   work should be able to be done locally, though.
     - Related to above, we may want to make a google account 
     for the project so that we can all deploy if needed 
         (we'll talk about it).
